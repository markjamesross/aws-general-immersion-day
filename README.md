# aws-general-immersion-day

Repo of resources created by Terraform to support people doing the AWS General Immersion Day.  Note - I've deliberately written this 'long hand', without using any code saving techniques like modules, for_each or count, and I've hardcoded a number of things to mimic the instructions in the immersion day as I wanted to make it as easy to follow as possible.  Think of it as 'my first Terraform' type standards.

Follow the Immersion Day [here]() and enable the relevant Terraform resources as you go through the day.

Read my write up on experiencing the Networking Immersion Day [here]().

- download repo
- authenticate to AWS
- run 'terraform init'
- run 'terraform apply'

As you go through the labs you need to remove the /* */ around the relevant sections of code
