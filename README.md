# aws-general-immersion-day

Repo of resources created by Terraform to support people doing the AWS General Immersion Day.  Note - I've deliberately written this 'long hand', without using any code saving techniques like modules, for_each or count, and I've hardcoded a number of things to mimic the instructions in the immersion day as I wanted to make it as easy to follow as possible.  Think of it as 'my first Terraform' type standards.

Follow the Immersion Day [here](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/f3a3e2bd-e1d5-49de-b8e6-dac361842e76/en-US/preparation-guide) and enable the relevant Terraform resources as you go through the day.
